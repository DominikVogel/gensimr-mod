\usage{
model_tfidf(mm, normalize = FALSE, smart = "nfc", pivot = NULL,
  slope = 0.25, ...)

\method{model_tfidf}{mm_file}(mm, normalize = FALSE, smart = "nfc",
  pivot = NULL, slope = 0.25, ...)

\method{model_tfidf}{mm}(mm, normalize = FALSE, smart = "nfc",
  pivot = NULL, slope = 0.25, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mm}{A matrix market as returned by \code{\link{mmcorpus_serialize}}.}

\item{normalize}{ormalize document vectors to unit euclidean length? You can also inject your own function into normalize.}

\item{smart}{SMART (System for the Mechanical Analysis and Retrieval of Text) 
Information Retrieval System, a mnemonic scheme for denoting tf-idf weighting variants in 
the vector space model. The mnemonic for representing a combination of weights takes the form XYZ, 
for example \code{nfc}, \code{bpn} and so on, where the letters represents the term weighting of the document vector.
See SMART section.}

\item{pivot}{You can either set the pivot by hand, or you can let Gensim figure it out automatically with the following two steps: 
1) Set either the u or b document normalization in the smartirs parameter.
2) Set either the corpus or dictionary parameter. The pivot will be automatically determined from the properties of the corpus or dictionary.
If pivot is \code{NULL} and you donâ€™t follow steps 1 and 2, then pivoted document length normalization will be disabled.}

\item{slope}{Setting the slope to 0.0 uses only the pivot as the norm, and setting the slope to 1.0 effectively disables pivoted 
document length normalization. Singhal [2] suggests setting the slope between 0.2 and 0.3 for best results.}
