  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  She's crying with all her might and main,
  And she won't eat her dinner - rice pudding again -
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  I've promised her dolls and a daisy-chain,
  And a book about animals - all in vain -
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  She's perfectly well, and she hasn't a pain;
  But, look at her, now she's beginning again! -
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  I've promised her sweets and a ride in the train,
  And I've begged her to stop for a bit and explain -
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?
  She's perfectly well and she hasn't a pain,
  And it's lovely rice pudding for dinner again!
  What is the matter with Mary Jane?"
